This repo is a _*made-from-scratch*_ timetable using basic table tags for structuring and styled-components for styling. The language chosen was TypeScript for learning purposes.

In case you want to create your Timetable using this repo, proceed as follows:

1. Clone the repo into your machine

2. Install dependencies with `yarn install`, then start the app with `yarn start`.

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

4. To replace the courses go to the file `events.ts` located inside the `src` folder.

5. Create the Courses you are taking as classes to avoid writing repetitive code (DRY).

6. Inside the `TimeTableData` array, place the courses in their respective time and day, ****time**** being the object of the `TimeTableData`'s array and ****day**** being an attribute of the time object.

7. Save the changes and view them in the browser.

8. Create a production build with `yarn build`. For deployment you can use
   [Render](https://render.com/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for
   continuous deployment.
